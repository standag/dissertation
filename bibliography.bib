Appropriate validation techniques may be used to reveal problems in structures, ideally before they are analysed, published or deposited. Additionally, such techniques may be used a posteriori to assess the (relative) merits of a model by potential users. Weak validation methods and statistics assess how well a model reproduces the information that was used in its construction (i.e. experimental data and prior knowledge). Strong methods and statistics, on the other hand, test how well a model predicts data or information that were not used in the structure-determination process. These may be data that were excluded from the process on purpose, general knowledge about macromolecular structure, information about the biological role and biochemical activity of the molecule under study or its mutants or complexes and predictions that are based on the model and that can be tested experimentally.},

The refinement of the 3k78 model against these structure factors leads to an isomorphous structure different from the deposited model with an implausibly small R value (0.019). The abnormal refinement is compared with normal refinement of an isomorphous variant structure of Bet v 1l (PDB entry 1fm4). A variety of analytical tools, including the application of Diederichs plots, R$\sigma$ plots and bulk-solvent analysis are discussed as promising aids in validation. The examination of the Bet v 1d structure also cautions against the practice of indicating poorly defined protein chain residues through zero occupancies. The recommendation to preserve diffraction images is amplified.},

However, high-resolution structural information of the connectivity between receptor and the Gbetagamma dimer has not previously been available. Here, we describe the structural determinants of Gbeta1gamma2 in complex with a C-terminal region of the parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTH1R) as obtained by X-ray crystallography. The structure reveals that several critical residues within PTH1R contact only Gbeta residues located within the outer edge of WD1- and WD7-repeat segments of the Gbeta toroid structure. These regions encompass a predicted membrane-facing region of Gbeta thought to be oriented in a fashion that is accessible to the membrane-spanning receptor. Mutation of key receptor contact residues on Gbeta1 leads to a selective loss of function in receptor/heterotrimer coupling while preserving Gbeta1gamma2 activation of the effector phospholipase-C beta.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

@article{Bruno,
abstract = {The crystallographically determined bond length, valence angle, and torsion angle information in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) has many uses. However, accessing it by means of conventional substructure searching requires nontrivial user intervention. In consequence, these valuable data have been underutilized and have not been directly accessible to client applications. The situation has been remedied by development of a new program (Mogul) for automated retrieval of molecular geometry data from the CSD. The program uses a system of keys to encode the chemical environments of fragments (bonds, valence angles, and acyclic torsions) from CSD structures. Fragments with identical keys are deemed to be chemically identical and are grouped together, and the distribution of the appropriate geometrical parameter (bond length, valence angle, or torsion angle) is computed and stored. Use of a search tree indexed on key values, together with a novel similarity calculation, then enables the distribution matching any given query fragment (or the distributions most closely matching, if an adequate exact match is unavailable) to be found easily and with no user intervention. Validation experiments indicate that, with rare exceptions, search results afford precise and unbiased estimates of molecular geometrical preferences. Such estimates may be used, for example, to validate the geometries of libraries of modeled molecules or of newly determined crystal structures or to assist structure solution from low-resolution (e.g. powder diffraction) X-ray data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates are involved in a variety of fundamental biological processes and pathological situations. They therefore have a large pharmaceutical and diagnostic potential. Knowledge of the 3D structure of glycans is a prerequisite for a complete understanding of their biological functions. The largest source of biomolecular 3D structures is the Protein Data Bank. However, about 30{\%} of all 1663 PDB entries (version September 2003) containing carbohydrates comprise errors in glycan description. Unfortunately, no software is currently available which aligns the 3D information with the reported assignments. It is the aim of this work to fill this gap. RESULTS: The pdb-care program http://www.glycosciences.de/tools/pdb-care/ is able to identify and assign carbohydrate structures using only atom types and their 3D atom coordinates given in PDB-files. Looking up a translation table where systematic names and the respective PDB residue codes are listed, both assignments are compared and inconsistencies are reported. Additionally, the reliability of reported and calculated connectivities for molecules listed within the HETATOM records is checked and unusual values are reported. CONCLUSION: Frequent use of pdb-care will help to improve the quality of carbohydrate data contained in the PDB. Automatic assignment of carbohydrate structures contained in PDB entries will enable the cross-linking of glycobiology resources with genomic and proteomic data collections.},

abstract = {Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus are the type species of the highly pathogenic paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus, which can cause severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis infections in humans, with case fatality rates approaching 75{\%}. NiV contains two envelope glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G glycoprotein (NiV-G) that facilitates attachment to host cells and the fusion (F) glycoprotein that mediates membrane merger. The henipavirus G glycoproteins lack both hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities and, instead, engage the highly conserved ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 cell surface proteins as their entry receptors. Here, we report the crystal structures of the NiV-G both in its receptor-unbound state and in complex with ephrin-B3, providing, to our knowledge, the first view of a paramyxovirus attachment complex in which a cellular protein is used as the virus receptor. Complex formation generates an extensive protein-protein interface around a protruding ephrin loop, which is inserted in the central cavity of the NiV-G beta-propeller. Analysis of the structural data reveals the molecular basis for the highly specific interactions of the henipavirus G glycoproteins with only two members (ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3) of the very large ephrin family and suggests how they mediate in a unique fashion both cell attachment and the initiation of membrane fusion during the virus infection processes. The structures further suggest that the NiV-G/ephrin interactions can be effectively targeted to disrupt viral entry and provide the foundation for structure-based antiviral drug design.},

Molecule primitives are atoms, bonds, properties, branching, and rings. User-defined features can be added via a Java interface. In MQL, molecules are represented as graphs. Substructure matching was implemented using the Ullmann algorithm because of favorable run-time performance. The Ullmann algorithm carries out a fast subgraph isomorphism search by combining backtracking with effective forward checking. MQL software design was driven by the aim to facilitate the use of various cheminformatics toolkits. Two Java interfaces provide a bridge from our MQL package to an external toolkit: the first one provides the matching rules for every feature of a particular toolkit; the second one converts the found match from the internal format of MQL to the format of the external toolkit. We already implemented these interfaces for the Chemistry Development Toolkit.},

@article{Hauck2013,
abstract = {The treatment of infections due to the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often difficult, as a consequence of bacterial biofilm formation. Such a protective environment shields the bacterium from host defense and antibiotic treatment and secures its survival. One crucial factor for maintenance of the biofilm architecture is the carbohydrate-binding lectin LecB. Here, we report the identification of potent mannose-based LecB inhibitors from a screening of four series of mannosides in a novel competitive binding assay for LecB. Cinnamide and sulfonamide derivatives are inhibitors of bacterial adhesion with up to a 20-fold increase in affinity to LecB compared to the natural ligand methyl mannoside. Because many lectins of the host require terminal saccharides (e.g., fucosides), such capped structures as reported here may offer a beneficial selectivity profile for the pathogenic lectin. Both classes of compounds show distinct binding modes at the protein, offering the advantage of a simultaneous development of two new lead structures as anti-pseudomonadal drugs with an anti-virulence mode of action.},

abstract = {Carbohydrates are the most abundant natural products. Besides their role in metabolism and as structural building blocks, they are fundamental constituents of every cell surface, where they are involved in vital cellular recognition processes. Carbohydrates are a relatively untapped source of new drugs and therefore offer exciting new therapeutic opportunities. Advances in the functional understanding of carbohydrate-protein interactions have enabled the development of a new class of small-molecule drugs, known as glycomimetics. These compounds mimic the bioactive function of carbohydrates and address the drawbacks of carbohydrate leads, namely their low activity and insufficient drug-like properties. Here, we examine examples of approved carbohydrate-derived drugs, discuss the potential of carbohydrate-binding proteins as new drug targets (focusing on the lectin families) and consider ways to overcome the challenges of developing this unique class of novel therapeutics.},

In this review, we discuss the computational methods for building QSAR models. We start with outlining their usefulness in high-throughput screening and identifying the general scheme of a QSAR model. Following, we focus on the methodologies in constructing three main components of QSAR model, namely the methods for describing the molecular structure of compounds, for selection of informative descriptors and for activity prediction. We present both the well-established methods as well as techniques recently introduced into the QSAR domain.},

The two predominant approaches for the modelling and various interpretations of electron density distributions are presented. Their potential translations into chemical concepts are explained. The focus of the article lies on the deduction of chemical properties from charge density studies in some selected main group compounds. The relationship between the obtained numerical data and commonly accepted simple chemical concepts unfortunately is not always straightforward, and often the chemist relies on heuristic connections rather than rigorously defined ones. This article tries to demonstrate how charge density analyses can shed light on aspects of chemical bonding and reactivity resulting from the determined bonding situation. Sometimes this helps to identify misconceptions and sets the scene for new unconventional synthetic approaches.},

The next section on structure-based approaches includes pharmcophores from ligand-protein complexes, FLIP and 3D protein-ligand binding interactions. The whole is rounded off with a complete section devoted to applications and examples, including modeling of ADME properties. With its critical evaluation of pharmacophore-based strategies, this book represents a valuable aid for project leaders and decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as pharmacologists, and medicinal and chemists.},

This growth in potential targets has increased the demand for reliable target validation, as well as technologies that can identify rapidly several quality lead candidates. Virtual screening, and in particular receptor-based virtual screening, has emerged as a reliable, inexpensive method for identifying leads. Although still an evolving method, advances in computational techniques have enabled virtual screening to have a positive impact on the discovery process. Here, the current strengths and weaknesses of the technology are discussed, and emphasis is placed on aspects of the work-flow of a virtual screening campaign, from preparation through to post-screening analysis.},

abstract = {Three different database docking programs (Dock, FlexX, Gold) have been used in combination with seven scoring functions (Chemscore, Dock, FlexX, Fresno, Gold, Pmf, Score) to assess the accuracy of virtual screening methods against two protein targets (thymidine kinase, estrogen receptor) of known three-dimensional structure. For both targets, it was generally possible to discriminate about 7 out of 10 true hits from a random database of 990 ligands. The use of consensus lists common to two or three scoring functions clearly enhances hit rates among the top 5\% scorers from 10\% (single scoring) to 25?40\% (double scoring) and up to 65?70\% (triple scoring). However, in all tested cases, no clear relationships could be found between docking and ranking accuracies. Moreover, predicting the absolute binding free energy of true hits was not possible whatever docking accuracy was achieved and scoring function used. As the best docking/consensus scoring combination varies with the selected target and the physicochemistry of target-ligand interactions, we propose a two-step protocol for screening large databases: (i) screening of a reduced dataset containing a few known ligands for deriving the optimal docking/consensus scoring scheme, (ii) applying the latter parameters to the screening of the entire database.

abstract = {A major problem in virtual screening concerns the accuracy of the binding free energy between a target protein and a putative ligand. Here we report an example supporting the outperformance of the AutoDock scoring function in virtual screening in comparison to the other popular docking programs. The original AutoDock program is in itself inefficient to be used in virtual screening because the grids of interaction energy have to be calculated for each putative ligand in chemical database. However, the automation of the AutoDock program with the potential grids defined in common for all putative ligands leads to more than twofold increase in the speed of virtual database screening. The utility of the automated AutoDock in virtual screening is further demonstrated by identifying the actual inhibitors of various target enzymes in chemical databases with accuracy higher than the other docking tools including DOCK and FlexX. These results exemplify the usefulness of the automated AutoDock as a new promising tool in structure-based virtual screening.},

The new descriptors are not as good as the original descriptors in selecting actives if one considers the average over all probes, but the new descriptors do better for several individual probes. Generally we find that whether one descriptor does better than another varies from probe to probe in a way almost impossible to predict a priori.

BRUTUS aligns molecules using field information derived from charge distributions and van der Waals shapes of the compounds. Molecules can have similar biological properties if their charge distributions and shapes are similar, even though they have different chemical structures; that is, BRUTUS can identify compounds possessing similar properties, regardless of their structures. In this paper, we present two applications of BRUTUS. First, BRUTUS was used to superimpose five sets of inhibitors. Second, two sets of known inhibitors were searched from a database, and the results were analyzed using self-organizing maps. We demonstrate that BRUTUS is successful in superimposing compounds using molecular fields and, importantly, is fast and accurate enough for virtual screening of chemical databases using a standard personal computer. This fast and efficient molecular-field-based algorithm is applicable for virtual screening of structurally diverse, active molecules.},

abstract = {ShaEP is a tool for rigid-body superimposition and similarity evaluation of ligand-sized molecules. Molecular overlay methods traditionally work on either substructures, molecular surfaces or interaction fields, or atom-centered Gaussian functions representing the molecular volume. While substructure searches are unlikely to reveal hits that are chemically different from the template structure, the other methods are capable of "scaffold hopping". Methods that match characteristic points in interaction fields can find alignments in situations where only some portions of the structures match but potentially miss good alignments if the used point sets are not detailed enough, which in turn increases the runtime of the used graph algorithms beyond practical limits. The faster, polynomially scaling volumetric methods consider the whole space to be equally important, which works well for molecules of equal size but partial matches might go undetected. ShaEP aims to capture the strengths of both field-based and volumetric approaches. It generates initial superimpositions using a matching algorithm on graphs that coarsely represent the electrostatic potential and local shape at points close to the molecular surfaces. The initial alignments are then optimized by maximization of the volume overlap of the molecules, computed using Gaussian functions. ShaEP overlays drug-sized molecules on a subsecond timescale, allowing for the screening of large virtual libraries. The program is available free of charge from www.abo.fi/fak/mnf/bkf/research/johnson/software.php.},

@article{Lemmen1998,
abstract = {If no structural information about a particular target protein is available, methods of rational drug design try to superimpose putative ligands with a given reference, e.g., an endogenous ligand. The goal of such structural alignments is, on the one hand, to approximate the binding geometry and, on the other hand, to provide a relative ranking of the ligands with respect to their similarity. An accurate superposition is the prerequisite of subsequent exploitation of ligand data by either 3D QSAR analyses, pharmacophore hypotheses, or receptor modeling. We present the automatic method FLEXS for structurally superimposing pairs of ligands, approximating their putative binding site geometry. One of the ligands is treated as flexible, while the other one, used as a reference, is kept rigid. FLEXS is an incremental construction procedure. The molecules to be superimposed are partitioned into fragments. Starting with placements of a selected anchor fragment, computed by two alternative approaches, the remaining fragments are added iteratively. At each step, flexibility is considered by allowing the respective added fragment to adopt a discrete set of conformations. The mean computing time per test case is about 1:30 min on a common-day workstation. FLEXS is fast enough to be used as a tool for virtual ligand screening. A database of typical drug molecules has been screened for potential fibrinogen receptor antagonists. FLEXS is capable of retrieving all ligands assigned to platelet aggregation properties among the first 20 hits. Furthermore, the program suggests additional interesting candidates, likely to be active at the same receptor. FLEXS proves to be superior to commonly used retrieval techniques based on 2D fingerprint similarities. The accuracy of computed superpositions determines the relevance of subsequently performed ligand analyses. In order to validate the quality of FLEXS alignments, we attempted to reproduce a set of 284 mutual superpositions derived from experimental data on 76 protein-ligand complexes of 14 proteins. The ligands considered cover the whole range of drug-size molecules from 18 to 158 atoms (PDB codes: 3ptb, 2er7). The performance of the algorithm critically depends on the sizes of the molecules to be superimposed. The limitations are clearly demonstrated with large peptidic inhibitors in the HIV and the endothiapepsin data set. Problems also occur in the presence of multiple binding modes (e.g., elastase and human rhinovirus). The most convincing results are achieved with small- and medium-sized molecules (as, e.g., the ligands of trypsin, thrombin, and dihydrofolate reductase). In more than half of the entire test set, we achieve rms deviations between computed and observed alignment of below 1.5 A. This underlines the reliability of FLEXS-generated alignments.},

They are immediately applicable to both $\pi$ and $\sigma$ bonds, including bonds involving hybrid AOs of all kinds, and they take account directly of the effects of variations in bond length on bond strength. In the last section of this paper, a number of ways of defining LCAO bond orders are reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages discussed. If all LCAO parameters $\beta$ are assumed proportional to corresponding overlap integrals S times suitable mean atomic ionization energies Ī, a simple general approximate formula for covalent resonance energies is obtained in terms of partial overlap populations and Ī\&apos;s, including one or two empirical coefficients. This formula indicates that forced hybridization (see III of this series) due to inner shells should make important negative contributions to bond energies. The application of the formula to H2, CO, and H2O is discussed. The assumption of proportionality of $\beta$ values to SĪ values may be useful also in estimating unknown $\beta$ values.},

abstract = {With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,\&apos;\&apos; or into partial and total ``net atomic populations\&apos;\&apos; together with ``overlap populations.\&apos;\&apos; ``Gross atomic populations\&apos;\&apos; distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded. Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the $\pi$ bonds in CO, the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the $\pi$ electrons is about twice that for the $\sigma$ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94\% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.},

abstract = {The treatment of molecules and crystals by the Heitler‐London method or by the collective electron model can be based on the atomic orbitals $\phi$$\mu$ of the system. These orbitals are in general overlapping, and the corresponding overlap integrals S $\mu$$\nu$, given by (1), have almost universally been neglected in the literature as causing undesirable complications. Here we will take these overlap integrals into consideration and show that they, instead of being negligible, are of essential importance in molecules and in crystals. The problem is simply solved by considering the orthonormalized functions [open phi]$\mu$, given by (21), as the real atomic orbitals. The solution is worked out in detail for (I) the molecular orbital method of treating molecules, (II) the Bloch orbital method of treating crystals, and (III) the Heitler‐London method of treating both these systems in some simple spin cases. Some numerical applications are given for ionic crystals, showing that the overlap effects are responsible for all the repulsive forces in these solids. It is also shown that the overlapping adds interesting new features to the properties of molecules and crystals, namely the ``many‐orbital‐effects,\&apos;\&apos; corresponding to certain ``many‐body‐forces\&apos;\&apos; in ionic solids.},

@article{Marenich2009,
abstract = {We present a new continuum solvation model based on the quantum mechanical charge density of a solute molecule interacting with a continuum description of the solvent. The model is called SMD, where the "D" stands for "density" to denote that the full solute electron density is used without defining partial atomic charges. "Continuum" denotes that the solvent is not represented explicitly but rather as a dielectric medium with surface tension at the solute-solvent boundary. SMD is a universal solvation model, where "universal" denotes its applicability to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known (in particular, dielectric constant, refractive index, bulk surface tension, and acidity and basicity parameters). The model separates the observable solvation free energy into two main components. The first component is the bulk electrostatic contribution arising from a self-consistent reaction field treatment that involves the solution of the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for electrostatics in terms of the integral-equation-formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM). The cavities for the bulk electrostatic calculation are defined by superpositions of nuclear-centered spheres. The second component is called the cavity-dispersion-solvent-structure term and is the contribution arising from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell. This contribution is a sum of terms that are proportional (with geometry-dependent proportionality constants called atomic surface tensions) to the solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. The SMD model has been parametrized with a training set of 2821 solvation data including 112 aqueous ionic solvation free energies, 220 solvation free energies for 166 ions in acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide, 2346 solvation free energies for 318 neutral solutes in 91 solvents (90 nonaqueous organic solvents and water), and 143 transfer free energies for 93 neutral solutes between water and 15 organic solvents. The elements present in the solutes are H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, and Br. The SMD model employs a single set of parameters (intrinsic atomic Coulomb radii and atomic surface tension coefficients) optimized over six electronic structure methods: M05-2X/MIDI!6D, M05-2X/6-31G, M05-2X/6-31+G, M05-2X/cc-pVTZ, B3LYP/6-31G, and HF/6-31G. Although the SMD model has been parametrized using the IEF-PCM protocol for bulk electrostatics, it may also be employed with other algorithms for solving the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for continuum solvation calculations in which the solute is represented by its electron density in real space. This includes, for example, the conductor-like screening algorithm. With the 6-31G basis set, the SMD model achieves mean unsigned errors of 0.6-1.0 kcal/mol in the solvation free energies of tested neutrals and mean unsigned errors of 4 kcal/mol on average for ions with either Gaussian03 or GAMESS.},

abstract = {A new method for calculating geometry-dependent atomic charges (GDACs) for polypeptides is presented. It overcomes the limitations of the partial equalization of orbital electronegativity (PEOE) and modified PEOE (MPEOE) methods, which depend only on connectivity, not geometry. Introduction of distance-dependent damping factors helps to include the effect of environment in determining the variation of bond distance (without explicit contribution of the correlated variation of bond angles), and thereby to reduce the number of parameters required to represent different atomic species. Since the correlation between the geometry and the dipole moments of molecules is crucial for this method, ab initio molecular orbital calculations were carried out to obtain the geometries and dipole moments with the 6-31G** basis set at the level of B3LYP theory. When bond distances are fixed prior to a charge calculation, the methodology outlined here leads to a direct calculation of the permanent molecular charge distribution represented as a set of distributed monopoles that depend on the geometry of the molecule. Hence, this method automatically accounts for the transferability of charges of small amino acid residues to build up a large polypeptide molecule, and can therefore provide an approximate description of any redistribution of charge density of large polypeptide molecules. The parameters characterizing the charge transfer in the formation of bonds were optimized by using dipole moment components and total dipole moments of 50 molecules that serve as models for the backbone and side chains of proteins. The calculated total dipole moments of these 50 molecules agree well with the ab initio results within an error of 5\%. The new charge scheme has been applied to seven conformers of N-acetylalanine-N?-methylamide (Ac-Ala-NHMe) with good agreement between ab initio and GDAC dipole moments. This method, however, gives poor results for conjugated systems that are larger than amides.

@article{Oliferenko2006,
abstract = {Since the atomic point charges came into wide use as the electrostatic part of modern molecular force fields, dozens of empirical and semiempirical charge calculation methods were developed over the last few decades. Many of them employ electronegativity equalization, one of the DFT cornerstone principles. We show that algebraically all known electronegativity equalization schemes can be divided into two different groups with respect to the underlying mathematical formalism and the degree to which electronegativity is equalized. Methods of the first group are based on the generalized hardness matrix formalism and provide complete electronegativity equalization, whereas another group of methods invokes the Laplacian matrix formalism and results in a redistribution of electronegativity rather than complete equalization. A new principle of electronegativity relaxation is introduced. Electronegativity identified with electrical potential is viewed as a harmonic function satisfying a discrete Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A Markov chain formalism for solving such equations is developed. Some numerical results of chemical interest are discussed. Application of atomic charges in different areas of molecular modeling is overviewed.},

To validate the approaches, the parameters of the proposed charge schemes were fitted to best reproduce MEP simultaneously on grids around a set of 227 diverse organic compounds. The residual errors in MEP reproduction due to calculated atomic charges were compared to those due to charges from known charge schemes.},

abstract = {Assigning effective atomic charges that properly reproduce the electrostatic fields of molecules is a crucial step in the construction of accurate interatomic potentials. We propose a new approach to calculate these charges, which as previous approaches are, is based on the idea of charge equilibration. However, we only allow charge to flow between covalently bonded neighbors by using the concept of so-called split charges. The semiempirical fit parameters in our approach do not only reflect atomic properties (electronegativity and atomic hardness) but also bond-dependent properties. The new method contains two popular but hitherto disjunct approaches as limiting cases. We apply our methodology to a set of molecules containing the elements silicon, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Effective charges derived from electrostatic potential surfaces can be predicted more than twice as accurately as with previous works, at the expense of one additional fit parameter per bond type controlling the polarizability between two bonded atoms. Additional bond-type parameters can be introduced, but barely improve the results. An increase in accuracy of only 30\% over existing techniques is achieved when predicting Mulliken charges. However, this could be improved with additional bond-type parameters.},

Its effect is to restrain charge transfer between remote atoms. As a consequence, systems in gas phase naturally decompose into neutral fragments. This result is achieved using two empirical parameters in addition to atomic electronegativities and hardnesses.},

abstract = {The electronegativity equalization method (EEM) was developed by Mortier et al. as a semiempirical method based on the density-functional theory. After parameterization, in which EEM parameters A(i), B(i), and adjusting factor kappa are obtained, this approach can be used for calculation of average electronegativity and charge distribution in a molecule. The aim of this work is to perform the EEM parameterization using the Merz-Kollman-Singh (MK) charge distribution scheme obtained from B3LYP/6-31G* and HF/6-31G* calculations. To achieve this goal, we selected a set of 380 organic molecules from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and used the methodology, which was recently successfully applied to EEM parameterization to calculate the HF/STO-3G Mulliken charges on large sets of molecules. In the case of B3LYP/6-31G* MK charges, we have improved the EEM parameters for already parameterized elements, specifically C, H, N, O, and F. Moreover, EEM parameters for S, Br, Cl, and Zn, which have not as yet been parameterized for this level of theory and basis set, we also developed. In the case of HF/6-31G* MK charges, we have developed the EEM parameters for C, H, N, O, S, Br, Cl, F, and Zn that have not been parameterized for this level of theory and basis set so far. The obtained EEM parameters were verified by a previously developed validation procedure and used for the charge calculation on a different set of 116 organic molecules from the CSD. The calculated EEM charges are in a very good agreement with the quantum mechanically obtained ab initio charges.},

Furthermore, the sp(2) carbons in the aromatic rings are also separated from the other sp(2) carbons.

The quality of the modified EEM charges is evaluated by comparison with the B3LYP/6-31G* charges calculated for a series of polypeptides, not contained in the training set. For further comparison, the atomic parameters of the original EEM without including chemical environments are recalibrated under the same conditions.

The new framework, as the classical EEM, permits fast calculations of atomic charges in a given molecule for a small computational cost. The original EEM procedure needs to previously calibrate the different implied atomic hardness and electronegativity, using a chosen set of molecules. In the new EEM algorithm half the number of parameters needs to be calibrated, since a relationship between electronegativities and hardnesses has been found.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is a membrane-anchored human microsomal protein involved in the drug metabolism in liver. CYP2C9 consists of an N-terminal transmembrane anchor and a catalytic cytoplasmic domain. While the structure of the catalytic domain is well-known from X-ray experiments, the complete structure and its incorporation into the membrane remains unsolved. We constructed an atomistic model of complete CYP2C9 in a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine membrane and evolved it by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water on a 100+ ns time-scale. The model agrees well with known experimental data about membrane positioning of cytochromes P450. The entry to the substrate access channel is proposed to be facing the membrane interior while the exit of the product egress channel is situated above the interface pointing toward the water phase. The positions of openings of the substrate access and product egress channels correspond to free energy minima of CYP2C9 substrate ibuprofen and its metabolite in the membrane, respectively.},

abstract = {Many enzymes have buried active sites. The properties of the tunnels connecting the active site with bulk solvent affect ligand binding and unbinding and also the catalytic properties. Here, we investigate ligand passage in the haloalkane dehalogenase enzyme LinB and the effect of replacing leucine by a bulky tryptophan at a tunnel-lining position. Transient kinetic experiments show that the mutation significantly slows down the rate of product release. Moreover, the mechanism of bromide ion release is changed from a one-step process in the wild type enzyme to a two-step process in the mutant. The rate constant of bromide ion release corresponds to the overall steady-state turnover rate constant, suggesting that product release became the rate-limiting step of catalysis in the mutant. We explain the experimental findings by investigating the molecular details of the process computationally. Analysis of trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations with a tunnel detection software reveals differences in the tunnels available for ligand egress. Corresponding differences are seen in simulations of product egress using a specialized enhanced sampling technique. The differences in the free energy barriers for egress of a bromide ion obtained using potential of mean force calculations are in good agreement with the differences in rates obtained from the transient kinetic experiments. Interactions of the bromide ion with the introduced tryptophan are shown to affect the free energy barrier for its passage. The study demonstrates how the mechanism of an enzymatic catalytic cycle and reaction kinetics can be engineered by modification of protein tunnels.},

The first mechanism is similar to that postulated by Peter Mitchell, and is based on electrons and protons used to generate water coming from opposite sides of the membrane. The second mechanism was not initially anticipated, but is now firmly established as a proton pump. A brief review of the current state of our understanding of the proton pump of cytochrome oxidase is presented. We have come a long way since the initial observation of the pump by M{\aa}rten Wikstr{\"{o}}m in 1977, but a number of essential questions remain to be answered.},

abstract = {Tunnels and channels facilitate the transport of small molecules, ions and water solvent in a large variety of proteins. Characteristics of individual transport pathways, including their geometry, physico-chemical properties and dynamics are instrumental for understanding of structure-function relationships of these proteins, for the design of new inhibitors and construction of improved biocatalysts. CAVER is a software tool widely used for the identification and characterization of transport pathways in static macromolecular structures. Herein we present a new version of CAVER enabling automatic analysis of tunnels and channels in large ensembles of protein conformations. CAVER 3.0 implements new algorithms for the calculation and clustering of pathways. A trajectory from a molecular dynamics simulation serves as the typical input, while detailed characteristics and summary statistics of the time evolution of individual pathways are provided in the outputs. To illustrate the capabilities of CAVER 3.0, the tool was applied for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulation of the microbial enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA. CAVER 3.0 safely identified and reliably estimated the importance of all previously published DhaA tunnels, including the tunnels closed in DhaA crystal structures. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that analysis of molecular dynamics simulation is essential for the estimation of pathway characteristics and elucidation of the structural basis of the tunnel gating. CAVER 3.0 paves the way for the study of important biochemical phenomena in the area of molecular transport, molecular recognition and enzymatic catalysis. The software is freely available as a multiplatform command-line application at http://www.caver.cz.},

abstract = {The active site of cytochromes P450 is situated deep inside the protein next to the heme cofactor. Consequently, enzyme specificity and kinetics can be influenced by how substrates pass through the protein to access the active site and how products egress from the active site. We previously analysed the channels between the active site and the protein surface in P450 crystal structures available in October 2003 [R.C. Wade, P.J. Winn, I. Schlichting, Sudarko, A survey of active site access channels in cytochromes P450, J. Inorg. Biochem. 98 (2004) 1175-1182]. Since then, 52 new P450 structures have been made available, including entries for ten isozymes for which structures were not previously available. We present an updated survey covering all P450 crystal structures available in March 2006. This survey shows channels not observed earlier in crystal structures, some of which were identified in previous molecular dynamics simulations. The crystal structures demonstrate how some of the channels can merge when the protein structure opens up resulting in a wide cleft to the active site, caused largely by movements of the F-G helix-loop-helix and the B-C loop. Significant differences were observed between the channels in the crystal structures of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes. The multiplicity of channels suggests possibilities for substrate channelling to and from the P450s.},

abstract = {We describe a new algorithm, CHUNNEL, to automatically find, characterize, and display tunnels or pores in proteins. The correctness and accuracy of the algorithm is verified on a constructed set of proteins and used to analyze large sets of real proteins. The verification set contains proteins with artificially created pores of known path and width profile. The previous benchmark algorithm, HOLE, is compared with the new algorithm. Results show that the major advantage of the new algorithm is that it can successfully find and characterize tunnels with no a priori guidance or clues about the location of the tunnel mouth, and it will successfully find multiple tunnels if present. CHUNNEL can also be used in conjunction with HOLE, with the former used toprime HOLE and the latter to track and characterize the pores. Analysis was conducted on families of membrane protein structures culled from the Protein Data Bank as well as on a set of transmembrane proteins with predicted membrane-aqueous phase interfaces, yielding the first completely automated examination of tunnels through membrane proteins, including tunnels that exit in the membrane bilayer.},

abstract = {The potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans is an integral membrane protein with sequence similarity to all known K+ channels, particularly in the pore region. X-ray analysis with data to 3.2 angstroms reveals that four identical subunits create an inverted teepee, or cone, cradling the selectivity filter of the pore in its outer end. The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.},

abstract = {The enzyme acetylcholinesterase generates a strong electrostatic field that can attract the cationic substrate acetylcholine to the active site. However, the long and narrow active site gorge seems inconsistent with the enzyme's high catalytic rate. A molecular dynamics simulation of acetylcholinesterase in water reveals the transient opening of a short channel, large enough to pass a water molecule, through a thin wall of the active site near tryptophan-84. This simulation suggests that substrate, products, or solvent could move through this "back door," in addition to the entrance revealed by the crystallographic structure. Electrostatic calculations show a strong field at the back door, oriented to attract the substrate and the reaction product choline and to repel the other reaction product, acetate. Analysis of the open back door conformation suggests a mutation that could seal the back door and thus test the hypothesis that thermal motion of this enzyme may open multiple routes of access to its active site.},

The presence of a third plastoquinone Q(C) and a second plastoquinone-transfer channel, which were not observed before, suggests mechanisms for plastoquinol-plastoquinone exchange, and we calculated other possible water or dioxygen and proton channels. Putative oxygen positions obtained from a Xenon derivative indicate a role for lipids in oxygen diffusion to the cytoplasmic side of PSII. The chloride position suggests a role in proton-transfer reactions because it is bound through a putative water molecule to the Mn(4)Ca cluster at a distance of 6.5 A and is close to two possible proton channels.},

On average, the enzymes' overall structures equilibrate on a 50+ ns timescale. The very open CYP2B4 structure closes slowly over the course of the simulation. The volumes of the active sites fluctuate by more than 50{\%} during the MD runs; these fluctuations are mainly due to movements of the main chains, with only a handful of amino acid residues in CYP2B4, CYP2D6, CYP2A6 and CYP2C9 showing significant independent side chain movement. The volume of the active site of CYP2E1 fluctuates heavily, ranging from 220 to 1310 A(3), due to the opening and closing of gates to two adjacent cavities. CYP2E1 has the least hydrated active site of the studied CYPs; this is consistent with its preference for non-polar substrates. The CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 active sites are deeply buried, with access paths that are narrower than the radius of a water molecule. However, waters are still able to access these active sites due to local adaptations of the channel to accommodate their passage. This finding may imply that the access paths of the CYPs never fully open prior to contact with the substrate; instead, the substrate may induce adaptive conformational changes during its passage to the active site. This may also explain why some substrate recognition sites are localized along individual enzymes' access paths.},

Here we present the structural basis of ligand gating in a K(+) channel that opens in response to intracellular Ca(2+). We have cloned, expressed, analysed electrical properties, and determined the crystal structure of a K(+) channel (MthK) from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum in the Ca(2+)-bound, opened state. Eight RCK domains (regulators of K(+) conductance) form a gating ring at the intracellular membrane surface. The gating ring uses the free energy of Ca(2+) binding in a simple manner to perform mechanical work to open the pore.},

abstract = {Proteins containing concavities such as pockets, cavities, and tunnels or pores perform important functions in ligand-induced signal transduction, enzymatic catalysis, and in facilitating the permeation of small molecules through membranes. Computational algorithms for identifying such shapes are therefore of great use for studying the mechanisms of these reactions. We developed the novel toolkit PROPORES for pore identification and applied our program to the systems aquaporin, tryptophan synthase, leucine transporter, and acetylcholinesterase. As a novel feature, the program checks whether access to occluded ligand binding pockets or blocked channels can be achieved by systematically rotating side chains of the gating residues. In this way, we obtain a more flexible view of the putative structural adaptability of protein structures. For the four systems mentioned, the new method was able to identify connections between pores that are separated in the X-ray structures or to connect internal pores with the protein surrounding. The software is available from http://gepard.bioinformatik.uni-saarland.de/software/propores/. Proteins 2011. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {A new interactive graphics program is described that provides a quick and simple procedure for identifying, displaying, and manipulating the indentations, cavities, or holes in a known protein structure. These regions are defined as, e.g., the xo, yo, zo values at which a test sphere of radius r can be placed without touching the centers of any protein atoms, subject to the condition that there is some x < xo and some x > xo where the sphere does touch the protein atoms. The surfaces of these pockets are modeled using a modification of the marching cubes algorithm. This modification provides identification of each closed surface so that by "clicking" on any line of the surface, the entire surface can be selected. The surface can be displayed either as a line grid or as a solid surface. After the desired "pocket" has been selected, the amino acid residues and atoms that surround this pocket can be selected and displayed. The protein database that is input can have more than one protein "segment," allowing identification of the pockets at the interface between proteins. The use of the program is illustrated with several specific examples. The program is written in C and requires Silicon Graphics graphics routines.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450s form a ubiquitous protein family with functions including the synthesis and degradation of many physiologically important compounds and the degradation of xenobiotics. Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida has provided a paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome P450s. However, the mechanism by which camphor, the natural substrate of cytochrome P450cam, accesses the buried active site is a long-standing puzzle. While there is recent crystallographic and simulation evidence for opening of a substrate-access channel in cytochrome P450BM-3, for cytochrome P450cam, no such conformational changes have been observed either in different crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations. Here, a novel simulation method, random expulsion molecular dynamics, is presented, in which substrate-exit channels from the buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly oriented force on the substrate, in addition to the standard molecular dynamics force field. The random expulsion molecular dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate-bound structure of cytochrome P450BM-3, and then applied to complexes of cytochrome P450cam with different substrates and with product. Three pathways were identified, one of which corresponds to a channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis data. Exit via the water-filled channel, which was previously suggested to be a product exit channel, was not observed. The pathways obtained by the random expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions (up to 4 A) observed in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid, passage of camphor through cytochrome P450cam only requires small backbone motions (less than 2.4 A) in conjunction with side-chain rotations. Concomitantly, in almost all the exit trajectories, salt-links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers between secondary structure elements of the protein, are perturbed.},

abstract = {Three possible channels by which substrates and products can exit from the buried active site of cytochrome P450cam have been identified by means of random expulsion molecular dynamics simulations. In the investigation described here, we computed estimates of the relative probabilities of ligand passage through the three channels using steered molecular dynamics and adiabatic mapping. For comparison, the same techniques are also applied to investigate substrate egress from cytochrome P450-BM3. The channel in cytochrome P450cam, for which there is the most supporting evidence from experiments (which we name pathway 2a), is computed to be the most probable ligand exit channel. It has the smallest computed unbinding work and force. For this channel, the ligand exits between the F/G loop and the B' helix. Two mechanistically distinct, but energetically similar routes through this channel were observed, showing that multiple pathways along one channel are possible. The probability of ligand exit via the next most probable channel (pathway 3), which is located between the I helix and the F and G helices, is estimated to be less than 1/10 of the probability of exit along pathway 2a. Low-frequency modes of the protein extracted from an essential dynamics analysis of a 1 ns duration molecular dynamics simulation of cytochrome P450cam with camphor bound, support the opening of pathway 2a on a longer timescale. On longer timescales, it is therefore expected that this pathway becomes more dominant than estimated from the present computations.},

It has been suggested, however, that water molecules may be present within such cavities but are too disordered to be seen in conventional crystallographic analyses. In contrast, it is argued here that solvent mobility will be limited by the size of the cavity and for this reason high-occupancy solvent in cavities of typical volume should be readily detectable using X-ray crystallography. Recent experimental studies of cavity hydration are reviewed. Such studies are consistent with theoretical predictions that it is energetically unfavorable to have a single water molecule in an apolar cavity. As apolar cavities become larger, a point is reached where it is favorable to have the cavity occupied by a cluster of mutually H-bonded water molecules. The exact size of such a cavity in a protein is yet to be verified.},

abstract = {Recent approaches to tunnel computation in protein molecules based on computational geometry are able to satisfactorily compute the narrowest possible width of any tunnel leading from a specified position inside the protein molecule to its surface. However, chemists are not only interested in the minimal width of a tunnel, they would also like to consider other criteria such as the length of the tunnel or its volume. In this paper we present an extension of the recent approach to tunnel computation which could take these other criteria into account. Using Delaunay triangulation we compute the set of all the tunnels which have the widest possible narrowest part, and select the best representative of this set in view of its additional criteria. Even though the extension is straightforward, it has many useful practical impacts. The major contribution of this approach is that it allows us to evaluate dynamic properties of protein molecules by tracing a computed tunnel in the sequence of several molecule snapshots in time. This new approach was implemented and piloted on real biochemical data.},

abstract = {Here we use crystal structures to investigate and review channels and pathways for the transfer of substrates (water, plastoquinone (PQ)) and products (electrons, protons, oxygen, reduced PQ (PQH(2))) to, and from, the redox active catalytic sites of photosystem II (PSII). A putative oxygen channel has been identified which is about 21A in length, leading from the water splitting site to the lumen. This channel follows a path along the lumenal surface of CP43, passing across the interface of the large extrinsic loop which joins the fifth and sixth transmembrane helices of this chlorophyll binding protein. In so doing it seems to minimise interactions with the excited states of chlorophylls bound within the PSII complex, especially those that constitute the primary electron donor, P680. Two additional channels leading from the water splitting site, and also exiting at the lumen, were also identified. Their hydrophilic nature suggests that they probably facilitate the delivery of water to, and protons from, the catalytic site. Also discussed are unique features in the electron transfer pathway of PSII, as compared with those of purple photosynthetic bacteria, and structural implications of the PSII Q(B)-site in terms of PQ protonation and PQ/PQH(2) diffusion.},

abstract = {We provide here a list of 154 P450 genes and seven putative pseudogenes that have been characterized as of October 20, 1990. These genes have been described in a total of 23 eukaryotes (including nine mammalian and one plant species) and six prokaryotes. Of 27 gene families so far described, 10 exist in all mammals. These 10 families comprise 18 subfamilies, of which 16 and 14 have been mapped in the human and mouse genomes, respectively; to date, each subfamily appears to represent a cluster of tightly linked genes. We propose here a modest revision of the initially proposed (Nebert et al., DNA 6, 1-11, 1987) and updated (Nebert et al., DNA 8, 1-13, 1989) nomenclature system based on evolution of the superfamily. For the gene we recommend that the italicized root symbol CYP for human (Cyp for mouse), representing cytochrome P450, be followed by an Arabic number denoting the family, a letter designating the subfamily (when two or more exist), and an Arabic numeral representing the individual gene within the subfamily. A hyphen should precede the final number in mouse genes. We suggest that the human nomenclature system be used for other species. This system is consistent with our earlier proposed nomenclature for P450 of all eukaryotes and prokaryotes, except that we are discouraging the future use of cumbersome Roman numerals.},

Comparison of both methods indicates that the individual cytochromes P450 differ significantly in the flexibilities of their substrate-binding active sites. This finding probably accounts for the large number of isoforms of these enzymes (there are fifty-seven known cytochrome P450 genes in the human genome) and their functional versatility. On the other hand, most of the known cytochrome P450s have a set of common structural features, with an overall structure consisting of a relatively flexible domain (the distal side), a more rigid domain (the heme-binding core) and a domain on the proximal side of the hemoprotein with intermediate flexibility. Substrate access and product egress channels of CYP enzymes are also important structural elements as the majority of these channels are located in the flexible distal side; the location, flexibility, and function of these channels are discussed.},

We identified key residues in access tunnels connecting the buried active site with bulk solvent by rational design and randomized them by directed evolution. The most active mutant has large aromatic residues at two out of three randomized positions and two positions modified by site-directed mutagenesis. These changes apparently enhance activity with TCP by decreasing accessibility of the active site for water molecules, thereby promoting activated complex formation. Kinetic analyses confirmed that the mutations improved carbon-halogen bond cleavage and shifted the rate-limiting step to the release of products. Engineering access tunnels by combining computer-assisted protein design with directed evolution may be a valuable strategy for refining catalytic properties of enzymes with buried active sites.},

A stepwise procedure is followed in which the pore centre and pore axis are first identified and optimised using geometric criteria, and then the biggest and longest cavity through the channel is detected. Finally, pore features, including diameter profiles, pore-lining residues, size, shape and regularity of the pore are calculated, providing a quantitative and visual characterization of the channel. To illustrate the use of this tool, the method was applied to several structures of transmembrane channel proteins and was able to identify shape/size/residue features representative of specific channel families.

abstract = {The cytochrome P450s are a superfamily of enzymes that are found in all kingdoms of living organisms, and typically catalyze the oxidative addition of atomic oxygen to an unactivated C-C or C-H bond. Over 8000 nonredundant sequences of putative and confirmed P450 enzymes have been identified, but three-dimensional structures have been determined for only a small fraction of these. While all P450 enzymes for which structures have been determined share a common global fold, the flexibility and modularity of structure around the active site account for the ability of P450 enzymes to accommodate a vast number of structurally dissimilar substrates and support a wide range of selective oxidations. In this review, known P450 structures are compared, and some structural criteria for prediction of substrate selectivity and reaction type are suggested. The importance of dynamic processes such as redox-dependent and effector-induced conformational changes in determining catalytic competence and regio- and stereoselectivity is discussed, and noncrystallographic methods for characterizing P450 structures and dynamics, in particular, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are reviewed.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam with its substrate, camphor, bound has been refined to R = 0.19 at a normal resolution of 1.63 A. While the 1.63 A model confirms our initial analysis based on the 2.6 A model, the higher resolution structure has revealed important new details. These include a more precise assignment of sequence to secondary structure, the identification of three cis-proline residues, and a more detailed picture of substrate-protein interactions. In addition, 204 ordered solvent molecules have been found, one of which appears to be a cation. The cation stabilizes an unfavorable polypeptide conformation involved in forming part of the active site pocket, suggesting that the cation may be the metal ion binding site associated with the well-known ability of metal ions to enhance formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Another unusual polypeptide conformation forms the proposed oxygen-binding pocket. A localized distortion and widening of the distal helix provides a pocket for molecular oxygen. An intricate system of side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds aids in stabilizing the required local disruption in helical geometry. Sequence homologies strongly suggest a common oxygen-binding pocket in all P450 species. Further sequence comparisons between P450 species indicate common three-dimensional structures with changes focused in a region of the molecule postulated to be associated with the control of substrate specificity.},

This information can be visualized by means of cavity analysis. Numerous tools are available depicting cavities directly or identifying lining residues. So far, all available techniques base on a single conformation neglecting any form of protein and cavity dynamics. Here we report a novel, grid-based cavity detection method that uses protein and solvent residence probabilities derived from molecular dynamics simulations to identify (I) internal cavities, (II) tunnels or (III) clefts on the protein surface. Driven by a graphical user interface, output can be exported in PDB format where cavities are described as individually selectable groups of adjacent voxels representing regions of high solvent residence probability. Cavities can be analyzed in terms of solvent density, cavity volume and cross-sectional area along a principal axis. To assess dxTuber performance we performed test runs on a set of six example proteins representing the three main classes of protein cavities and compared our findings to results obtained with SURFNET, CAVER and PyMol.},

A crystal structure of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase in complex with the peripheral-site inhibitor aflatoxin is now presented, in which a tyrosine at the bottom of the active-site gorge rotates to create a 3.4-{\AA} wide exit channel. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the opening can be further enlarged by movement of Trp84. The crystallographic and molecular dynamics simulation data thus point to the interface between Tyr442 and Trp84 as the key element of a backdoor, whose opening permits rapid clearance of catalysis products from the active site. Furthermore, the crystal structure presented provides a novel template for rational design of inhibitors and reactivators, including anti-Alzheimer drugs and antidotes against organophosphate poisoning.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at normal and high temperature were used to study the flexibility and malleability of three microsomal cytochromes P450 (CYPs): CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2A6. Comparison of B-factors (describing the atomic fluctuations) between X-ray and MD data shows that the X-ray B-factors are significantly lower in the regions where the crystal contacts occur than for other regions. Consequently, the conclusions about CYP flexibility based solely on the X-ray data might be misleading. Comparison of flexibility patterns of the three CYPs enabled common features and variations in flexibility and malleability of the studied CYPs to be identified. The previously described pattern of flexibility in topological elements of microsomal CYPs (a rigid heme binding core, a malleable distal side and intermediately flexible proximal side) was confirmed. These topological features provide an important combination of high stereo- and regio-specificity (mediated by the relative rigidity in the neighborhood of the heme), together with high substrate promiscuity due to the more flexible active site and the malleability of the distal side. The data acquired here show that the malleability of the three studied CYPs correlates with their substrate specificity: CYP2A6 has a narrow substrate range and is the most rigid, CYP3A4 is the most promiscuous CYP known and is the most malleable, and CYP2C9 is intermediate in terms of both its substrate specificity and malleability. Thus, the malleability of CYPs is probably a major determinant of their substrate specificity.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4A resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (R(free) 37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

The tunnel is a component of a much larger, interconnected system of channels accessible to solvent that permeates the subunit and is connected to the exterior at many points. Since water and other small molecules can diffuse into and out of the tunnel along many different trajectories, the large subunit cannot be part of the seal that keeps ions from passing through the ribosome-translocon complex. The structure referred to as the tunnel is the only passage in the solvent channel system that is both large enough to accommodate nascent peptides, and that traverses the particle. For objects of that size, it is effectively an unbranched tube connecting the peptidyl transferase center of the large subunit and the site where nascent peptides emerge. At no point is the tunnel big enough to accommodate folded polypeptides larger than alpha-helices.},

abstract = {In cytochrome P450s, the active site is situated deep inside the protein next to the heme cofactor, and is often completely isolated from the surrounding solvent. To identify routes by which substrates may enter into and products exit from the active site, random expulsion molecular dynamics simulations were performed for three cytochrome P450s: CYP101, CYP102A1 and CYP107A1 [J. Mol. Biol. 303 (2000) 797; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 (2002) 5361]. Amongst the different pathways identified, one pathway was found to be common to all three cytochrome P450s although the mechanism of ligand passage along it was different in each case and apparently adapted to the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Recently, a number of new crystal structures of cytochrome P450s have been solved. Here, we analyse the open channels leading to the active site that these structures reveal. We find that in addition to showing the common pathway, they provide experimental evidence for the existence of three additional channels that were identified by simulation. We also discuss how the location of xenon binding sites in CYP101 suggests a role for one of the pathways identified by molecular dynamics simulations as a route for gaseous species, such as oxygen, to access the active site.},

abstract = {Water-permeable membranes of several plant and mammalian tissues contain specific water channel proteins, the 'aquaporins'. The best characterized aquaporin is CHIP, a 28 kDa red blood cell channel-forming integral protein. Isolated CHIP and Escherichia coli lipids may be assembled into 2-D crystals for structural analyses. Here we present (i) a structural characterization of the solubilized CHIP oligomers, (ii) projections of CHIP arrays after negative staining or metal-shadowing, and (iii) the 3-D structure at 1.6 nm resolution. Negatively stained CHIP oligomers exhibited a side length of 6.9 nm with four-fold symmetry, and a mass of 202 +/- 3 kDa determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Reconstituted into lipid bilayers, CHIP formed 2-D square lattices with unit cell dimensions a = b = 9.6 nm and a p422(1) symmetry. The 3-D map revealed that CHIP tetramers contain central stain-filled depressions about the fourfold axis. These cavities extend from both sides into the transbilayer domain of the molecule leaving only a thin barrier to be penetrated by the water pores. Although CHIP monomers behave as independent pores, we propose that their particular structure requires tetramerization for stable integration into the bilayer.},

abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a widely spread enzyme playing a very important role in nerve signal transmission. As AChE controls key processes, its inhibition leads to the very fast death of an organism, including humans. However, when this feature is to be used for killing of unwanted organisms (i.e. mosquitoes), one is faced with the question - how much do AChEs differ between species and what are the differences? Here, a theoretical point of view was utilized to identify the structural basis for such differences. The various primary and tertiary alignments show that AChEs are very evolutionary conserved enzymes and this fact could lead to difficulties, for example, in the search for inhibitors specific for a particular species.},

abstract = {Channels and cavities play important roles in macromolecular functions, serving as access/exit routes for substrates/products, cofactor and drug binding, catalytic sites, and ligand/protein. In addition, channels formed by transmembrane (TM) proteins serve as transporters and ion channels. MolAxis is a new sensitive and fast tool for the identification and classification of channels and cavities of various sizes and shapes in macromolecules. MolAxis constructs corridors, which are pathways that represent probable routes taken by small molecules passing through channels. The outer medial axis of the molecule is the collection of points that have more than one closest atom. It is composed of two-dimensional surface patches and can be seen as a skeleton of the complement of the molecule. We have implemented in MolAxis a novel algorithm that uses state-of-the-art computational geometry techniques to approximate and scan a useful subset of the outer medial axis, thereby reducing the dimension of the problem and consequently rendering the algorithm extremely efficient. MolAxis is designed to identify channels that connect buried cavities to the outside of macromolecules and to identify TM channels in proteins. We apply MolAxis to enzyme cavities and TM proteins. We further utilize MolAxis to monitor channel dimensions along Molecular Dynamics trajectories of a human Cytochrome P450. MolAxis constructs high quality corridors for snapshots at picosecond time-scale intervals substantiating the gating mechanism in the 2e substrate access channel. We compare our results with previous tools in terms of accuracy, performance and underlying theoretical guarantees of finding the desired pathways. MolAxis is available on line as a web-server and as a stand alone easy-to-use program (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MolAxis/).},

Given a protein or nucleic acid structure in the PDB format, the server outputs all possible channels that connect buried cavities to the outside of the protein or points to the main channel in TM proteins. For each channel, the gating residues and the narrowest radius termed 'bottleneck' are also given along with a full list of the lining residues and the channel surface in a 3D graphical representation. The users can manipulate advanced parameters and direct the channel search according to their needs.

Despite the importance of MSAs for medical applications and basic research, their molecular mechanisms of action on tubulin and microtubules remain elusive. We determined high-resolution crystal structures of Î±Î²-tubulin in complex with two unrelated MSAs, zampanolide and epothilone A. Both compounds were bound to the taxane pocket of Î²-tubulin and used their respective side chains to induce structuring of the M-loop into a short helix. Because the M-loop establishes lateral tubulin contacts in microtubules, these findings explain how taxane-site MSAs promote microtubule assembly and stability. Further, our results offer fundamental structural insights into the control mechanisms of microtubule dynamics.},

	abstract = {Using a Bax-dependent membrane-permeabilization assay, we show that peptides corresponding to the BH3 domains of Bcl-2 family "BH3-only" proteins have dual functions. Several BH3 peptides relieved the inhibition of Bax caused by the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) and/or Mcl-1 proteins, some displaying a specificity for either Bcl-x(L) or Mcl-1. Besides having this derepression function, the Bid and Bim peptides activated Bax directly and were the only BH3 peptides tested that could potently induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cultured cells. Furthermore, Bax activator molecules (cleaved Bid protein and the Bim BH3 peptide) synergistically induced cytochrome c release when introduced into cells along with derepressor BH3 peptides. These observations support a unified model of BH3 domain function, encompassing both positive and negative regulation of other Bcl-2 family members. In this model, the simple inhibition of antiapoptotic functions is insufficient to induce apoptosis unless a direct activator of Bax or Bak is present.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of enzymes as biological catalysts, study of their enormous catalytic power and exquisite specificity has been central to biochemistry. Nevertheless, there is no universally accepted comprehensive description. Rather, numerous proposals have been presented over the past half century. The difficulty in developing a comprehensive description for the catalytic power of enzymes derives from the highly cooperative nature of their energetics, which renders impossible a simple division of mechanistic features and an absolute partitioning of catalytic contributions into independent and energetically additive components. Site-directed mutagenesis has emerged as an enormously powerful approach to probe enzymatic catalysis, illuminating many basic features of enzyme function and behavior. The emphasis of site-directed mutagenesis on the role of individual residues has also, inadvertently, limited experimental and conceptual attention to the fundamentally cooperative nature of enzyme function and energetics. The first part of this review highlights the structural and functional interconnectivity central to enzymatic catalysis. In the second part we ask: What are the features of enzymes that distinguish them from simple chemical catalysts? The answers are presented in conceptual models that, while simplified, help illustrate the vast amount known about how enzymes achieve catalysis. In the last section, we highlight the molecular and energetic questions that remain for future investigation and describe experimental approaches that will be necessary to answer these questions. The promise of advancing and integrating cutting edge conceptual, experimental, and computational tools brings mechanistic enzymology to a new era, one poised for novel fundamental insights into biological catalysis.},

In all of these polyfunctional enzymes, a product formed from the catalytic reaction at one active site is a substrate for an enzymatic reaction at a distal active site. Reaction intermediates are translocated from one active site to the next through the participation of an intermolecular tunnel. The tunnel in tryptophan synthase is approximately 25 A in length, whereas the tunnel in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is nearly 100 A long. Kinetic studies have demonstrated that the individual reactions are coordinated through allosteric coupling of one active site with another. The participation of these molecular tunnels is thought to protect reactive intermediates from coming in contact with the external medium.},

	abstract = {CYP19A1, also known as aromatase or estrogen synthetase, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of estrogens from their corresponding androgens. Several clinically used breast cancer therapies target aromatase. In this work, explicitly solvated all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of aromatase with a model of the lipid bilayer and the transmembrane helix are performed. The dynamics of aromatase and the role of titration of an important amino acid residue involved in aromatization of androgens are investigated via two 250-ns long simulations. One simulation treats the protonated form of the catalytic aspartate 309, which appears more consistent with crystallographic data for the active site, while the simulation of the deprotonated form shows some notable conformational shifts. Ensemble-based computational solvent mapping experiments indicate possible novel druggable binding sites that could be utilized by next-generation inhibitors. In addition, the effects of protonation on the ligand positioning and channel dynamics are investigated using geometrical models that estimate the opening width of critical channels. Significant differences in channel dynamics between the protonated and deprotonated trajectories are exhibited, suggesting that the mechanism for substrate and product entry and the aromatization process may be coupled to a "locking" mechanism and channel opening. Our results may be particularly relevant in the design of novel drugs, which may be useful therapeutic treatments of cancers such as those of the breast and prostate.},

	abstract = {Human aromatase (HA), an enzyme located on the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum, is of crucial biological importance in the biosynthesis of estrogens. High levels of estrogens are related with important pathologies, conferring to HA a key role as a pharmacological target. In this study we provide, for the first time, an atomistic model of HA embedded on a membrane model to understand the influence of the membrane lipophilic environment on the structural and dynamical properties of HA and on the access/egress pathways of the substrate (androstenedione, ASD) and of the oxygen molecule (involved in the enzymatic process) into/from the HA active site. To this end we used several computational techniques such as force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Random Expulsion MD, Steered MD, and Implicit Ligand Sampling. Our results show that the membrane anchoring does not markedly affect the structural properties and the flexibility of the protein, but they clearly point out that the membrane has a marked effect on the access/egress routes of the reactants, stabilizing the formation of different channels for both ASD and O(2) with respect to those observed in pure water solution. Due to the importance of HA in medicine and since access/egress channels may influence its substrate selectivity, a detailed understanding of the role of the membrane in shaping these channels may be of valuable help in drug design.},

@article{Madrona2013,
	abstract = {In P450cin, Tyr81, Asp241, Asn242, two water molecules, and the substrate participate in a complex H-bonded network. The role of this H-bonded network in substrate binding and catalysis has been probed by crystallography, spectroscopy, kinetics, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics. For the Y81F mutant, the substrate binds about 20-fold more weakly and Vmax decreases by about 30{\%} in comparison to WT. The enhanced susceptibility of the heme to Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚-mediated destruction in Y81F suggests that this mutant favors the open, low-spin conformational state. Asn242 H-bonds directly with the substrate, and replacing this residue with Ala results in water taking the place of the missing Asn side chain. This mutant exhibits a 70{\%} decrease in activity. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations of substrate-bound complexes show that the solvent has more ready access to the active site, especially for the N242A mutant. This accounts for about a 64{\%} uncoupling of electron transfer from substrate hydroxylation. These data indicate the importance of the interconnected water network on substrate binding and on the open/closed conformational equilibrium, which are both critically important for maintaining high-coupling efficiency.},

	abstract = {Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 7B1 is a steroid cytochrome P450 7$\alpha$-hydroxylase that has been linked directly with bile salt synthesis and hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5). The enzyme provides the primary metabolic route for neurosteroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cholesterol derivatives 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HOChol), and other steroids such as 5$\alpha$-androstane-3$\beta$,17$\beta$-diol (anediol), and 5$\alpha$-androstene-3$\beta$,17$\beta$-diol (enediol). A series of investigations including homology modeling, molecular dynamics (MD), and automatic docking, combined with the results of previous experimental site-directed mutagenesis studies and access channels analysis, have identified the structural features relevant to the substrate selectivity of CYP7B1. The results clearly identify the dominant access channels and critical residues responsible for ligand binding. Both binding free energy analysis and total interaction energy analysis are consistent with the experimental conclusion that 25-HOChol is the best substrate. According to 20 ns MD simulations, the Phe cluster residues that lie above the active site, particularly Phe489, are proposed to merge the active site with the adjacent channel to the surface and accommodate substrate binding in a reasonable orientation. The investigation of CYP7B1-substrate binding modes provides detailed insights into the poorly understood structural features of human CYP7B1 at the atomic level, and will be valuable information for drug development and protein engineering.},

	abstract = {Methanotrophs consume methane as their major carbon source and have an essential role in the global carbon cycle by limiting escape of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. These bacteria oxidize methane to methanol by soluble and particulate methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Soluble MMO contains three protein components, a 251-kilodalton hydroxylase (MMOH), a 38.6-kilodalton reductase (MMOR), and a 15.9-kilodalton regulatory protein (MMOB), required to couple electron consumption with substrate hydroxylation at the catalytic diiron centre of MMOH. Until now, the role of MMOB has remained ambiguous owing to a lack of atomic-level information about the MMOH-MMOB (hereafter termed H-B) complex. Here we remedy this deficiency by providing a crystal structure of H-B, which reveals the manner by which MMOB controls the conformation of residues in MMOH crucial for substrate access to the active site. MMOB docks at the $\alpha$(2)$\beta$(2) interface of $\alpha$(2)$\beta$(2)$\gamma$(2) MMOH, and triggers simultaneous conformational changes in the $\alpha$-subunit that modulate oxygen and methane access as well as proton delivery to the diiron centre. Without such careful control by MMOB of these substrate routes to the diiron active site, the enzyme operates as an NADH oxidase rather than a monooxygenase. Biological catalysis involving small substrates is often accomplished in nature by large proteins and protein complexes. The structure presented in this work provides an elegant example of this principle.},

Isoprenylation is followed by cleavage of the AAX amino acid residues and, in some cases, by additional proteolytic cuts. We determined the crystal structure of the CAAX protease Ste24p, a zinc metalloprotease catalyzing two proteolytic steps in the maturation of yeast mating pheromone a-factor. The Ste24p core structure is a ring of seven transmembrane helices enclosing a voluminous cavity containing the active site and substrate-binding groove. The cavity is accessible to the external milieu by means of gaps between splayed transmembrane helices. We hypothesize that cleavage proceeds by means of a processive mechanism of substrate insertion, translocation, and ejection.},

The CorA family is ubiquitous and is primarily responsible for Mg(2+) transport. However, the key questions-such as, the ion selectivity, the transport pathway, and the gating mechanism-have remained unanswered for this protein family. We present a 3.2 {\AA} resolution structure of the archaeal CorA from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which is a unique complete structure of a CorA protein and reveals the organization of the selectivity filter, which is composed of the signature motif of this family. The structure reveals that polar residues facing the channel coordinate a partially hydrated Mg(2+) during the transport. Based on these findings, we propose a unique gating mechanism involving a helical turn upon the binding of Mg(2+) to the regulatory intracellular binding sites, and thus converting a polar ion passage into a narrow hydrophobic pore. Because the amino acids involved in the uptake, transport, and gating are all conserved within the entire CorA family, we believe this mechanism is general for the whole family including the eukaryotic homologs.},

	abstract = {Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGLs) play an important role in lipid catabolism across all kingdoms of life by catalyzing the release of free fatty acids from monoacylglycerols. The three-dimensional structures of human and a bacterial MGL were determined only recently as the first members of this lipase family. In addition to the $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase core, they showed unexpected structural similarities even in the cap region. Nevertheless, the structural basis for substrate binding and conformational changes of MGLs is poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of five crystal structures of MGL from Bacillus sp. H257 in its free form and in complex with different substrate analogs and the natural substrate 1-lauroylglycerol. The occurrence of different conformations reveals a high degree of conformational plasticity of the cap region. We identify a specific residue, Ile-145, that might act as a gatekeeper restricting access to the binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ile-145 leads to significantly reduced hydrolase activity. Bacterial MGLs in complex with 1-lauroylglycerol, myristoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl substrate analogs enable identification of the binding sites for the alkyl chain and the glycerol moiety of the natural ligand. They also provide snapshots of the hydrolytic reaction of a bacterial MGL at different stages. The alkyl chains are buried in a hydrophobic tunnel in an extended conformation. Binding of the glycerol moiety is mediated via Glu-156 and water molecules. Analysis of the structural features responsible for cap plasticity and the binding modes of the ligands suggests conservation of these features also in human MGL.},

In 2001, we highlighted the effects of large-to-small amino acid replacements on rates for ligand entry and exit onto the three-dimensional structure of sperm whale myoglobin. The resultant map argued strongly for ligand movement through a short channel from the heme iron to solvent that is gated by the distal histidine (His-64(E7)) near the solvent edge of the porphyrin ring. In this work, we have applied the same mutagenesis mapping strategy to the neuronal mini-hemoglobin from Cerebratulus lacteus (CerHb), which has a large internal tunnel from the heme iron to the C-terminal ends of the E and H helices, a direction that is 180Â° opposite to the E7 channel. Detailed comparisons of the new CerHb map with expanded results for Mb show unambiguously that the dominant (>90{\%}) ligand pathway in CerHb is through the internal tunnel, and the major (>75{\%}) ligand pathway in Mb is through the E7 gate. These results demonstrate that: 1) mutagenesis mapping can identify internal pathways when they exist; 2) molecular dynamics simulations need to be refined to address discrepancies with experimental observations; and 3) alternative pathways have evolved in globins to meet specific physiological demands.},

Selection of the cosolvent type and concentration range for an enzymatic reaction is challenging and requires extensive empirical testing. An understanding of protein-solvent interaction could provide a theoretical framework for rationalising the selection process. Here, the behaviour of three model enzymes (haloalkane dehalogenases) was investigated in the presence of three representative organic cosolvents (acetone, formamide, and isopropanol). Steady-state kinetics assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of enzyme-solvent interactions. Cosolvent molecules entered the enzymes' access tunnels and active sites, enlarged their volumes with no change in overall protein structure, but surprisingly did not act as competitive inhibitors. At low concentrations, the cosolvents either enhanced catalysis by lowering K(0.5) and increasing k(cat), or caused enzyme inactivation by promoting substrate inhibition and decreasing k(cat). The induced activation and inhibition of the enzymes correlated with expansion of the active-site pockets and their occupancy by cosolvent molecules. The study demonstrates that quantitative analysis of the proportions of the access tunnels and active-sites occupied by organic solvent molecules provides the valuable information for rational selection of appropriate protein-solvent pair and effective cosolvent concentration.},

Here we present a new version of the CSA (CSA 2.0), which greatly expands the number of both curated (968) and automatically annotated catalytic sites in enzyme structures, utilizing a new method for annotation transfer. The curated entries are used, along with the variation in residue type from the sequence comparison, to generate 3D templates of the catalytic sites, which in turn can be used to find catalytic sites in new structures. To ease the transfer of CSA annotations to other resources a new ontology has been developed: the Enzyme Mechanism Ontology, which has permitted the transfer of annotations to Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes (MACiE) and UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB) resources.

	abstract = {The MACiE database contains 223 distinct step-wise enzyme reaction mechanisms and holds representatives from each EC sub-subclass where there is a crystal structure and sufficient evidence in the literature to support a mechanism. Each catalytic step of every reaction sequence in MACiE is fully annotated so that it includes the function of the catalytic residues involved in the reaction and the mechanism by which substrates are transformed into products. Using MACiE as a knowledge base, we have seen that the top 10 most catalytic residues are histidine, aspartate, glutamate, lysine, cysteine, arginine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Of these only seven (cysteine, histidine, aspartate, lysine, serine, threonine and tyrosine) dominate catalysis and provide essentially five functional roles that are essential. Stabilisation is the most common and essential role for all classes of enzyme, followed by general acid/base (proton acceptor and proton donor) functionality, with nucleophilic addition following closely behind (nucleophile and nucleofuge). We investigated the occurrence of these residues in MACiE and the Catalytic Site Atlas and found that, as expected, certain residue types are associated with each functional role, with some residue types able to perform diverse roles. In addition, it was seen that different EC classes of enzyme have a tendency to employ different residues for catalysis. Further, we show that whilst the differences between EC classes in catalytic residue composition are not immediately obvious from the general classes of Ingold mechanisms, there is some weak correlation between the mechanisms involved in a given EC class and the functions that the catalytic amino acid residues are performing. The analysis presented here provides a valuable insight into the functional roles of catalytic amino acid residues, which may have applications in many aspects of enzymology, from the design of novel enzymes to the prediction and validation of enzyme reaction mechanisms.},

abstract = "Cytochrome \{P450s\} (CYPs) are heme-containing monooxygenases that contribute to an enormous range of enzymatic function including biosynthetic and detoxification roles. This review summarizes recent studies concerning interactions of \{CYPs\} with ligands including substrates, inhibitors, and diatomic heme-ligating molecules. These studies highlight the complexity in the relationship between the heme spin state and active site occupancy, the roles of water in directing protein ligand and ligand heme interactions, and the details of interactions between heme and gaseous diatomic \{CYP\} ligands. Both kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of ligand binding are considered. "
